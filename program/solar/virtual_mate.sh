# A 'u' character means that the program shouldn't check that character.
# usually, in an actual mate packet, that unused character will always be a 0
# By using a 'u' character, we basically add an assertion to our "unit test" that the program will not read it because it is unused.
# If the program, for some reason does try and read the 'u' character, it will crash after it tries to parse a base-10 digit from it.
