 * This class is designed to contain queries relating to statistics over a particular time range.

 * Example queries that this should support:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>energy used between 12am and 3am (kWh)</li>
 *     <li>average battery voltage</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Hopefully this can one day encompass the logic that {@link SolarThingGraphQLBatteryRecordService} has so we can generalize it better
