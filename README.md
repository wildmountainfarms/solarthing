### Examples
SolarThing Android: [Github](https://github.com/wildmountainfarms/solarthing-android)
|
[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.retrodaredevil.solarthing.android)

SolarThing Android displays data in a persistent notification that updates at a configurable rate

<hr/>

If you decide to use InfluxDB, you can easily create your own Dashboard with [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana).

Grafana is very customizable. Rearrange graphs and make it how you want!

[SolarThing Web](https://github.com/wildmountainfarms/solarthing-web)

While it takes some configuring, SolarThing web is a simple way to display solar data.

### Can I run this?
Of course! This runs on Java 8+ and has been tested to work with Java 8 and Java 11. This runs on Linux, Windows and Mac,
but is easiest to set up on Linux systems running Debian with systemd (such as the default Raspberry Pi OS or Ubuntu).

This repository always has a compiled and up to date [jar file containing the SolarThing program](program/solarthing.jar).

## Usage at Wild Mountain Farms
We monitor an Outback MATE2 with a Raspberry Pi 1 and a Renogy Rover charge controller with a Raspberry Pi Zero W.
Both SolarThing instances upload data to CouchDB and InfluxDB, both hosted on the computer also hosting Grafana and SolarThing Web.
Another computer gets data from CouchDB and uploads it to PVOutput using the `pvoutput-upload` program.

## Using the program
You can see the [Outback/Renogy Rover](other/solar/README.md) README for using the program with outback or renogy products.

The [input and output](other/docs/input_and_outputs.md) README is documentation for the `io` JSON property option used in all of the sub programs.

### Compiling
Run `./compile_and_move.sh`. (You only need to do this if you've changed the code) This updates [solarthing.jar](program/solarthing.jar).

### Database Setup
[CouchDB setup](other/docs/couchdb.md)<br/>
*Used for the android and web application*

[InfluxDB setup](other/docs/influxdb_config.md)<br/>
*Used for Grafana*

#### Configuration
This uses all JSON for configuring everything. The files you edit are all in one place unless you decide to move them.

See [Quickstart](other/docs/quickstart.md) to see how to set them up

### Suggestions?
If you have suggestions on how to improve the documentation or have a feature request, I'd love to
hear from you! [SolarThing Issues](https://github.com/wildmountainfarms/solarthing/issues)

If you get confused while trying to configure solarthing, that's probably because the documentation is
always a work in progress. If you find something confusing, please report it, so I can make it clearer.
