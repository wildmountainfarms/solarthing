# Grafana
SolarThing works great with Grafana!

Look in the [dashboards](dashboards) folder for example dashboards. 

You can copy-paste the JSON
data into a new Grafana dashboard, and with a few tweaks, you're good to go! However, many times copy-pasting
the entire JSON will give you errors and may not work depending on your Grafana version. There's no
perfect solution to this. Sometimes I'll recommend that you find the queries you want in the raw JSON data,
and copy-paste that to your own existing dashboard.

If you want to copy-paste a dashboard, using [simple_graphql.json](dashboards/simple_graphql.json) is the simplest, and
may work right out of the box for you!
