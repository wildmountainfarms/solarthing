## Installing Java 11 on RPi1 or RPi0 (**Outdated Documentation**)

NOTE: This page was originally created so that people could install Java 11 on RPi1 or RPi0.
SolarThing no longer supports these devices!

If you have an RPi1 or RPi0, they both have ARMv6 processors, so you need to install Java 11 differently.

NOTE: You don't have to use Java 11. Using Java 8 with SolarThing is perfectly fine. **Go [here](./installing_java.md)
for normal (simple) installation.**

### Installing with sdkman
Note: I currently cannot get this method to work on my Raspberry Pi Zero.

First, install sdkman:
```shell
# https://sdkman.io/install
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
```
Now, go [here](https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?version=java-11-lts&os=linux&architecture=arm-32-bit-hf&package=jdk)
and check what the latest Java 11 version is (It should be something like 11.0.10+9). Now, for 11.0.10+9, you'd run this command:
```shell
# https://sdkman.io/jdks
sdk list java # you can install one of these packages if you'd like
# This will take a while to "repackage"
sdk install java 11.0.10-zulu
```
Now java should be installed! The reason we use the zulu version is that they support ARMv6.

### Installing Manually
https://pi4j.com/documentation/java-installation/
```shell
mkdir -p /home/pi/Downloads
cd /home/pi/Downloads
# Note: Go here to get a newer verison to download: https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?version=java-11-lts&os=linux&architecture=arm-32-bit-hf&package=jdk
wget https://cdn.azul.com/zulu-embedded/bin/zulu11.45.27-ca-jdk11.0.10-linux_aarch32hf.tar.gz

cd /usr/lib/jvm
sudo tar -xf ~/Downloads/zulu11.45.27-ca-jdk11.0.10-linux_aarch32hf.tar.gz
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/lib/jvm/zulu11.45.27-ca-jdk11.0.10-linux_aarch32hf/bin/java 100
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /usr/lib/jvm/zulu11.45.27-ca-jdk11.0.10-linux_aarch32hf/bin/javac 100

sudo update-alternatives --config java
sudo update-alternatives --config javac
```
Note that using since we didn't use `update-java-alternatives` we only have `java` and `javac` changed, which is enough
for most people's use cases.

### Using Sdkman to install to solarthing user
This is work in progress, please do not attempt this:

```shell
(echo 'export SDKMAN_DIR="/opt/solarthing/program/.downloads/sdkman"' && curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io?rcupdate=false") | sudo -u solarthing bash

echo 'export SDKMAN_DIR="/opt/solarthing/program/.downloads/sdkman";source "/opt/solarthing/program/.downloads/sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh";sdk version' | sudo -u solarthing bash
```
